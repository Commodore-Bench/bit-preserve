# KIM-1 Schematic

The schematic for the KIM-1 was taken from the KIM-1 users manual, the MOS technology hardware manual for the 65xx series and the KIM-1 wall poster, all were origional materials that came with the reference KIM-1 system. There were a few places when component values in the documentaion didn't match the actual values in the reference system. In these cases I used the actual value in the reference system.
