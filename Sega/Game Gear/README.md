## Sega Game Gear Schematic

* VA1 Japan / USA (837-9023, 837-9129, 837-9024, 837-9130, single chip solution)
* DC Power (Shared)
* Sound (Shared)
* VA0 (Europe, 3 chip solution)

Power and sound boards are nearly the same between different Game Gear models. So they are separated from the main boards.
